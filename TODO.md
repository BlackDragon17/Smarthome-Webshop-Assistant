# Future Work for SHWA

Being a university project, the Smarthome Webshop Assistant is more of a proof-of-concept or early prototype, rather than an actual complete product.

That being said, here is a (likely incomplete) list of things I would like to implement in SHWA, if I ever find the time to.

## Smaller changes

- Add bars-like compatScore display to Product
- Add action completion toast for at least device replacement
- Add purchase buttons to products
- Add user-customizable product sorting to DatabaseProductView
- Move action names to enums
- Fix URL bar theming on Chrome mobile
- Add more products
- Add product images
- Add product info & image to DeviceInfoModal
- Fetch Google Fonts from local copies

## Larger changes

- Move currentSetup to Pinia
- Add setup saving and management
- Switch to TypeScript for both Vue SFCs and JS assets
- Add translation (i18n)
- Add Vue Router
- Add other pages: home, settings, about, ...
- Add compatibility infos to Home Setup page
- Rework compatibility filtering
- Make UI mobile friendly
